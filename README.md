# Pandoc Conversion with Docker Compose

This project provides a Docker Compose setup to convert a Markdown file to various formats using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), a universal document converter. With the included `docker-compose.yml`, you can easily convert files like `README.md` to formats such as `.epub` without needing a local Pandoc installation.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or create a `docker-compose.yml` file using the contents below:

   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'

   services:
     pandoc:
       image: pandoc/core
       volumes:
         - .:/data
       user: "${UID}:${GID}"  # Runs the container with your user permissions
       working_dir: /data
       command: README.md -o outfile.epub
   ```

2. Place the Markdown file you want to convert (`README.md` by default) in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml`.

## Usage

To convert `README.md` to `outfile.epub`, run:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm pandoc
```

This command will:

- Launch the Pandoc container.
- Mount the current directory to `/data` inside the container.
- Convert `README.md` to `outfile.epub` in the same directory.

### Customizing the Command

To convert other files or change the output format, modify the `command` in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
command: YOUR_FILE.md -o OUTPUT_FILE.pdf
```

### Example Commands

Convert `README.md` to PDF:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm pandoc README.md -o outfile.pdf
```

Convert `README.md` to DOCX (Word document):

```bash
docker-compose run --rm pandoc README.md -o outfile.docx
```

## Notes

- **Permissions**: The container runs with the current userâ€™s UID and GID to avoid permission issues on the generated files.
- **Output**: The converted file will appear in the same directory as `README.md` and `docker-compose.yml`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter permission issues, check that Docker has permissions to access your project directory and that UID and GID are set correctly.
